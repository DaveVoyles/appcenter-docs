[Continuous Integration and Delivery for iOS](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/app-center-continuous-integration-and-delivery-for-ios?trk=course_title&upsellOrderOrigin=default_guest_learning).

Think about the last time you released an app. How many sessions did your beta testers run? How often did your app crash? Where did users spend the most time? Visual Studio App Center automatically gathers this data for you and consolidates it into a single web-based dashboard. It also provides a complete continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) solution for your iOS and macOS applications. Connect your repository to App Center and it builds your apps on cloud-hosted agents, automatically runs unit and UI tests on real devices, and distributes them to beta testers and app stores. After deployment, App Center helps you monitor your apps with crash reports and advanced analytics. It even lets you send targeted push notifications to keep your customers engaged.

This project-based course shows how to automate your iOS development process using the features provided by App Center. Discover how to start with a provided iOS Swift application and gradually incorporate App Center services. By the end of the course, you'll have a native iOS Swift app with a fully-integrated CI/CD pipeline.
