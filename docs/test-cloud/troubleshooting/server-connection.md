# Web Service and Server connection troubleshooting
[!INCLUDE [Retirement announcement for App Center](~/includes/retirement.md)]
There are several common reasons why your app may have trouble communicating with a server or web service:

- The endpoint the user is trying to connect to doesn't allow communication through the Test IP addresses.Â 
- Geofencing is blocking communication with our servers in Denmark.
- Additional time is needed for the communication to reliably complete.
- If a secondary app is required, or the connection process requires taking your app being tested out of focus. App Center Test allows single app automation, not multiple apps, or system processes.

## Allow List
If any of the following are blocked, you may need to explicitly allow them for your connection: 

- testcloud.xamarin.com (to allow incoming/outgoing traffic on ports 80 and 443)
- These IP addresses:
   - 195.249.159.238
   - 195.249.159.239
