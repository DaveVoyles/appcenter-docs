# Upload crashes via UI

[!INCLUDE [Retirement announcement for App Center](~/includes/retirement.md)]

If you have a native crash report from an Apple device, you can upload it via the App Center portal. The following sections will explain how to retrieve crash reports from a device and upload it to App Center.

## Retrieve crash reports from Apple devices
To retrieve crash reports from an Apple device, follow the instructions in [Apple's developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/diagnosing_issues_using_crash_reports_and_device_logs/acquiring_crash_reports_and_diagnostic_logs).

## Manually upload crash reports via Diagnostics UI
To manually upload Apple crash reports, follow the instructions below:

1. Log into App Center and select your app.
2. In the left menu, navigate to the **Diagnostics** section.
3. On the right top corner of page, click the three dots in the upper-right corner.
4. Select **Upload Crash Log**.
5. In the Crash Upload Dialog, follow the wizard to upload your crash report.
6. Once your report is successfully uploaded, you'll see a confirmation message.

Allow some time for the report to be processed for symbolication. The crash report will appear in the Diagnostics UI after it's processed.

> [!NOTE]
> Manually uploading crash reports are designed for the native iOS and macOS report formats. Content in other formats, including the text/JSON report tab of App Center crashes, can lead to unpredictable results and isn't supported.

## How are native crashes different from text reports or from the "raw" tab of the App Center report?
Whenever a crash occurs on iOS or macOS, a crash report is generated which can be downloaded from the device and uploaded to App Center via the manual crash upload dialog.

For iOS/macOS reports, the `raw` tab contains text, like the crash report, but the formats aren't identical. The `raw` tab is an App Center-specific representation which differs from system-generated reports. For example, the ordering of `version` and `build version number` isn't the same.
