To get started with our SDK, follow the platform-specific documentation at [Android](~/sdk/getting-started/android.md), [iOS](~/sdk/getting-started/ios.md), [macOS](~/sdk/getting-started/macos.md), [React Native](~/sdk/getting-started/react-native.md), [tvOS](~/sdk/getting-started/tvos.md), [UWP](~/sdk/getting-started/uwp.md), [WPF/WinForms](~/sdk/getting-started/wpf-winforms.md), and [MAUI/Xamarin](~/sdk/getting-started/xamarin.md).

## General information

Check out our [Frequently Asked Questions](~/analytics/faq.md) for general questions or concerns.

## Custom Events

Learn more about the interaction of your users with your app by tracking [Custom Events](~/analytics/event-metrics.md) in your app. To do this, follow our [SDK Documentation](~/sdk/index.md) for [Android](~/sdk/analytics/android.md), [iOS](~/sdk/analytics/ios.md), [React Native](~/sdk/analytics/react-native.md), [MAUI/Xamarin](~/sdk/analytics/xamarin.md), [Windows](~/sdk/analytics/windows.md), [macOS](~/sdk/analytics/macos.md), and [tvOS](~/sdk/analytics/tvos.md).

## Export
