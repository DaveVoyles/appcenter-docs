# Build Troubleshooting
The guides in this section provide general troubleshooting tips for App Center Build.

## General Tips
If you're unsure how to diagnose your issue, here are some general tips:
- Check our [Code Repo guide](~/build/troubleshooting/code-repos.md) if you're having trouble connecting your repo or finding your project in it. 
- [Compare working & failing builds](~/build/troubleshooting/build-failed.md) to isolate problems.
- [Download Build data](~/build/troubleshooting/backup-data.md) for local backup & comparison.
- Test any [custom build scripts](~/build/custom/scripts/index.md) locally. Also, manually save your Build config when adding, deleting, moving or renaming scripts. 
- Read about [Build Execution Time](~/build/troubleshooting/build-times.md) if your build is running slow or timing out unexpectedly.
