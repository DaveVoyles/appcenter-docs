# React Native Build

[!INCLUDE [Retirement announcement for App Center](~/includes/retirement.md)]

You can build React Native apps for both Android and iOS. To get started, use the following links:

- [Configuring your first Android build](~/build/react-native/android/index.md)
- [Configuring your first iOS build](~/build/react-native/ios/index.md)

Currently React Native Build doesn't contain support for Expo.

If you need further support in building your app, [contact us](~/help.md) and let us know more about your needs.
