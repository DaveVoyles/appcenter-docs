# Migrate from the HockeySDK to App Center WPF/Winforms
[!INCLUDE [Retirement announcement for App Center](../includes/retirement.md)]

[!INCLUDE [sdk migration dropdown](includes/sdk-migration-dropdown.md)]

## 1. Update the libraries
Replace HockeySDK.WPF NuGet package with the App Center ones in all projects in your solution.

### Visual Studio for Windows
* Open [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) for Windows.
* Click **File** > **Open** and choose your solution.
* In the solution navigator, right-click **References** and choose **Manage NuGet Packages**.
* Remove the **HockeySDK.WPF** package.
* Search for **App Center**, and install **Microsoft.AppCenter.Analytics**, and **Microsoft.AppCenter.Crashes** packages.

### Package Manager Console
* Open the console in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/). To do this, choose **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**.
* If you're working in **Visual Studio for Mac**, make sure you have **NuGet Package Management Extensions** installed. For this, choose **Visual Studio** > **Extensions**, search for **NuGet** and install, if necessary.
* Type the following commands in the console:

```shell
Uninstall-Package HockeySDK.WPF
Install-Package Microsoft.AppCenter.Analytics
Install-Package Microsoft.AppCenter.Crashes
```

The App Center SDK uses a modular approach â€“ you can choose which services you want to integrate. You must add each SDK module as a separate dependency in this section.

## 2. Update the SDK setup code
### 2.1 Convert the application identifier
The App Center SDK uses application identifiers in the globally unique identifier (GUID) format. Your HockeyApp App ID can be used by App Center but you need to convert it to a different format. To convert the identifier you must add four hyphens to get `8-4-4-4-12` representation.

Before (HockeyApp):
`00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff`

After (App Center):
`00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff`

### 2.2 Replace SDK initialization in the application code
1. Remove the old HockeyApp registration code.
    In the `using` statement declaration, remove the following line:

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.HockeyApp;
    ```

    In the beginning of the App class constructor, remove the following line:

    ```csharp
    HockeyClient.Current.Configure("Your_App_ID");
    ```

2. Start the App Center SDK.
    Add the appropriate namespaces before you use our APIs.

    ```csharp
    using Microsoft.AppCenter;
    using Microsoft.AppCenter.Analytics;
    using Microsoft.AppCenter.Crashes;
    ```

    Add the following call to your application's constructor:

    ```csharp
    AppCenter.Start("{Your App Secret}",  typeof(Analytics), typeof(Crashes));
    ```
