App Center Analytics helps you understand user behavior and customer engagement to improve your app. The SDK automatically captures session count and device properties like model, OS version, etc. You can define your own custom events to measure things that matter to you. All the information captured is available in the App Center portal for you to analyze the data.

> [!NOTE]
> iOS devices without a SIM card won't send the report with carrier country code to the App Center portal. If you want to provide a country value, use the `setCountryCode` method to override the country code from your device location.

> [!NOTE]
> In the `4.0.0` version of App Center breaking changes were introduced. Follow the [Migrate to App Center SDK 4.0.0 and higher](../getting-started/migration/apple-sdk-update.md) section to migrate App Center from previous versions.

Follow the [Get started](~/sdk/getting-started/ios.md) section if you haven't set up the SDK in your application yet.

[!INCLUDE [apple common methods](includes/apple-common-methods.md)]
