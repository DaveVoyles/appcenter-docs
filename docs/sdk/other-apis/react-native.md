## Adjust the log level

You can control the amount of log messages that show up from App Center. Log messages show in the console on iOS and LogCat on Android. Use the `setLogLevel` API to enable additional logging while debugging. The default level is `LogLevel.ASSERT` for the iOS App Store environment and Android release builds. Otherwise, it's set to `LogLevel.WARNING`.

To output all log messages, use `LogLevel.VERBOSE`.

```javascript
import AppCenter from 'appcenter';

await AppCenter.setLogLevel(AppCenter.LogLevel.VERBOSE);
```

> [!NOTE]
> The JavaScript `setLogLevel` API can't increase logging for app startup code, before JavaScript is loaded.
> 
> If you wish to increase logging for app startup, use the native App Center setLogLevel APIs.
> 
> In iOS, call `[MSACAppCenter setLogLevel: MSACLogLevelVerbose];` before any call to `[AppCenterReactNative register];` (or `AppCenterReactNativeAnalytics` or `AppCenterReactNativeCrashes` or `AppCenterReactNativePush`) in the project's **AppDelegate.m**. You must add `@import AppCenter;` if missing in that file.
> 
> In Android, call `AppCenter.setLogLevel(android.util.Log.VERBOSE);` before `SoLoader.init` in `onCreate` callback in `MainApplication.java`.

## Identify installations

The App Center SDK creates a UUID for each device once the app is installed. This identifier remains the same for a device when the app is updated and a new one is generated only when the app is re-installed or the user manually deletes all app data on Android. The following API is useful for debugging purposes.

```javascript
import AppCenter from 'appcenter';

const installId = await AppCenter.getInstallId();   // Returned as a string
```

## Identify users

The App Center SDK supports setting a **user ID** that's used to augment crash reports. To use this capability:

1. Configure the App Center SDK as described in the [App Center SDK Getting started guide](~/sdk/getting-started/react-native.md).
2. Set a `userID` in the SDK using the following code:

```javascript
AppCenter.setUserId("your-user-id");
```

[!INCLUDE [user id](includes/user-id.md)]

## Disable all services at runtime

If you want to disable all App Center services at once, use the `setEnabled()` API. When disabled, the SDK won't forward any information to App Center.

```javascript
import AppCenter from 'appcenter';

await AppCenter.setEnabled(false);
```

To enable all services at once again, use the same API but pass `true` as a parameter.

```javascript
await AppCenter.setEnabled(true);
```

The state is persisted in the device's storage across application launches.

## Disallow network requests

In the App Center SDK, network requests are allowed by default. If you want to send data that the App Center SDK collects by the user concern you can disallow automatic sending data.

```javascript
await AppCenter.setNetworkRequestsAllowed(false);
```

In this case, the App Center SDK continues to collect data but it will be sent only when the network requests will be allowed.

```javascript
await AppCenter.setNetworkRequestsAllowed(true);
```

>[!NOTE]
> This value is retained between starts.

At any time, you can check whether sending data in the App Center SDK is allowed or not.

```javascript
await AppCenter.isNetworkRequestsAllowed();
```

>[!NOTE]
> The value saved in SharedPreferences is ignored until `AppCenter` is started on Android platform.
> It will return the last value set using `setNetworkRequestsAllowed` or `true` if the value wasn't changed before AppCenter start.

## Change state of service in runtime

You can enable or disable the service at the runtime with following code:

```javascript
await AppCenter.Analytics.setEnabled(false);
```

## Check if App Center is enabled

You can also check if App Center is enabled or not.

```javascript
const enabled = await AppCenter.isEnabled();
```

## Check App Center SDK version at runtime
 
You can get the version of App Center SDK that you're currently using.
 
```javascript
AppCenter.getSdkVersion();
```
