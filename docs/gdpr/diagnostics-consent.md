# Handling User Consent for Diagnostics

[!INCLUDE [Retirement announcement for App Center](../includes/retirement.md)]

## Ask for the User's Consent To Send Diagnostics logs

If you want to get your users' confirmation before sending a crash/error report to App Center, the App Center SDK exposes a callback that instructs App Center Diagnostics to await confirmation from each user before sending any crash/error data to App Center.
