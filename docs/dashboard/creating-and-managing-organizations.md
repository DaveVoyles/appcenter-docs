# Creating and managing organizations

[!INCLUDE [Retirement announcement for App Center](~/includes/retirement.md)]

We recommend creating an organization for any apps with multiple collaborators to better manage users and their permissions.

## Organization roles

These are the three roles within an organization and the actions each can take:

| Roles | Create App | See all apps | Manage settings |  Add people | Manage Shared Distribution Groups and Teams |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| Admins | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Collaborators | Yes | Only if you belong | No | No | Yes |
| Members | Yes | Only if you belong | No | No | No |


* **Admins** are Managers of all the apps in the organization. Learn more about [app permissions](~/dashboard/creating-and-managing-apps.md).

* When someone gets added to an app owned by an organization, they get invited as **Members** of the organization.

## Creating an organization

To create an organization, log in and click the **Add new** dropdown and choose **Add new organization**.

> [!NOTE]
> When you create an organization, you automatically become an 'Admin'.

## Uploading an organization icon

Customize your organization by uploading an org icon:

1. On the left side navigation, select the organization
2. Select the **Manage** tab
3. On the right side of the screen, click the placeholder org icon
4. Select an image file no larger than 512px and doesn't exceed 1 MB

## Accessing organizations

All of your organizations are accessible in the left navigation.

## Adding users to an organization

There are two ways to add users to an organization:

**Directly to the organization:**

1. On the left side navigation, select the organization
2. Select **People**
3. Type the user's email address to add the user

This gives the user access to the organization as a collaborator. However, they won't see any of the apps listed in the organization unless they're explicitly invited to the app or if they're an admin of the organization.

**In-directly through an app:**

1. Select an app within an organization
2. On the left side navigation, select the **Settings** page
3. Select **People** 
4. Type the user's email address to add the user

Adding a user from outside the organization to an app automatically adds them to the organization. However, the user will only see the app(s) they were invited to.

## Changing users' organization roles

1. On the left side navigation, select the organization
2. Select **People**
3. Select the user
4. Use the dropdown to re-assign the role

Only 'Admins' can change the role of collaborators and other admins. 

## Removing users from an organization

1. On the left side navigation, select the organization
2. Select **People**
3. Select the collaborator
4. Click **Remove from organization**

Removing a collaborator from an organization will remove the user from all apps within the organization.

## Leaving an organization

1. Click on the App Center user menu in the upper-right corner of any page
2. Select **Account Settings**
3. Select **Organizations**
4. Click the **Leave** button by the organization you want to leave.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're the sole 'Admin' of an organization, you can't leave the organization. You can either promote another collaborator to 'Admin' or delete the entire organization.

## Deleting an organization

1. On the left side navigation, select the organization
2. Select **Manage**
3. On the upper right hand side, click the **Delete Organization** button

> [!NOTE]
> Only organization 'Admins' can delete organizations.

## Next steps

* [Create a team in your organization](~/dashboard/creating-and-managing-teams.md)
* [Connect to your repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, VSTS, or Azure DevOps)](~/build/index.md)
* [Add App Center's SDK to your app](~/sdk/index.md)
