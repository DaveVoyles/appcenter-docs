# Dashboard Frequently Asked Questions

[!INCLUDE [Retirement announcement for App Center](~/includes/retirement.md)]

**Where can I find my app secret?**

To get your App Secret, go to your app's settings. At the top right hand corner, click on the **triple vertical dots** and select `Copy app secret` to get your App Secret.

**Can I transfer apps in between users & organizations?**

To transfer an app to an organization, you must be the current owner of the app, as well as an Admin in the organization you're trying to transfer the app to. To transfer an app into a different organization, see [Managing apps in the dashboard](~/dashboard/creating-and-managing-apps.md#transferring-an-app).

**How can I add the same group of people to multiple apps?**

[Create a team](~/dashboard/creating-and-managing-teams.md) inside an organization which allows you to quickly add groups of Collaborators to apps.

**I've got an invitation to my email, but I'm not able to accept it. What should I do?**

Check which email you're using to log in to the App Center portal. You can find it in [Profile Settings](https://appcenter.ms/settings/profile). The invitation link only works for the targeted email address. Otherwise, you will not be able to accept it. If necessary, ask for a new invitation to the correct email address.
