# Publishing an Android App Bundle fails because app signing isn't enabled

[!INCLUDE [Retirement announcement for App Center](~/includes/retirement.md)]

When publishing an Android App Bundle .aab file, you may come across an error like this:

> Google Play app signing is not enabled for this package. You must enroll into app signing by Google Play to upload an Android App Bundle.

This error appears when you try to publish an app for which you haven't enabled app signing by Google Play. This is a requirement for releasing Android App Bundles. Follow the steps below to fix the issue.

## Fixing this issue

* Sign in to the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/).
* Open the settings for your app.
* Go to **Release management** > **App signing**.
* Follow the steps there to enable app signing by Google Play for your app.

See the official documentation by Google on [using app signing by Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423).
