# Migration Guide

[!INCLUDE [Retirement announcement for App Center](../../includes/retirement.md)]

Visual Studio App Center is the new home of CodePush. App Center is a development tool that includes a set of cloud services for building and managing mobile applications. App Center is the next generation of HockeyApp and Xamarin Test Cloud. Learn more about [App Center](/appcenter).

The movement of CodePush into App Center is a step forward in improving the overall user experience and progression of CodePush.

This guide was made to make moving from CodePush to App Center straightforward. Besides the use of a new CLI, we've tried to limit the changes you must make immediately. You won't have to make any changes in your code until the release of the new SDK next year.

If you're a current CodePush user, your account has already been migrated for you. All of your CodePush data can be accessed by logging into [App Center](https://appcenter.ms). If not, that's okay too! You can get started by [creating an account](https://appcenter.ms).

## Getting Started

### Setting up your account
Depending on the status of your account, the process is a little different:
- **Current CodePush users**: We've already migrated your account! No further action is required regarding account setup. You can access your account data by logging into [App Center](https://appcenter.ms).
- **New CodePush users**: Create an account on [App Center](https://appcenter.ms).

> [!NOTE]
> If you had both a CodePush and App Center account that shared an email address, then no further action is required. These accounts will be merged upon logging in to App Center.

### Getting Set up in the App Center Portal
Once you log in, the first thing you'll see is a list of all your applications. If you had a previous CodePush application, you should find it listed and annotated.

The back-end migration of CodePush was completed on June 2, 2017. If any of your apps were made before this date, you must specify the OS and Platform of the app.

We don't currently support Cordova apps in the portal. You can still use the App Center CLI, and we're working on supporting additional platforms. App Center's mission is to provide quality support for as many platforms as possible. Periodically check out the [App Center blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vsappcenter/) for news or updates, and our [product roadmap](/appcenter/general/roadmap).

If you imported a React Native app, or are starting a new React Native app, you should see an app overview panel that lets you manage your app and shows how to add other App Center SDKs. Your App Center app secret is what allows your app to send information to App Center, it isn't the same as your CodePush deployment keys. CodePush deployment keys can be checked by opening the terminal and running:

```shell
appcenter codepush deployment list <ownerName>/<appName> --displayKeys
```

### Install the App Center CLI
To start releasing updates to your end users, you must install the App Center CLI. To install it, open a terminal window or command prompt and execute the following command:

```shell
npm install -g appcenter-cli
```

Once installed, use the `appcenter` command, see below for the available commands.

To log in to your account use `appcenter login`. This command will open the App Center website and present you with an authentication token.

The token must be put into the CLI for authentication and to complete the login process.

Now you're free to use CodePush functionality in your apps through the App Center CLI.

## Using CodePush in the App Center Portal
CodePush can be found within the Distribution section of the App Center portal. CodePush is only visible in App Center when using React Native, and soon Cordova applications.

If your application has a history of releases for a given deployment, these releases will be visible. Switching between deployments is as simple as using the dropdown at the upper right-hand corner of the screen.

![Release Detail](./images/mg-portal-3.png)

Clicking the "Edit" button will provide you with a panel for patching your release. Editing the items on this page would be equivalent to using `appcenter codepush patch`.

![Release Patch](./images/mg-portal-4.png)

For now, developers using CodePush must distribute releases using the release commands in the App Center CLI. If you create your React Native app using the dashboard then you must create default deployments using App Center.

![CreateDeployments](./images/mg-portal-5.png)

Or you can use the following commands in the App Center CLI to create the recommended deployments before pushing a release:

```shell
appcenter codepush deployment add -a <ownerName>/<appName> Staging
appcenter codepush deployment add -a <ownerName>/<appName> Production
```

## The App Center CLI Experience
![CLI](./images/mg-terminalpic.png)

This section was constructed to enable you to see some of the most common CodePush commands and how they've changed within the App Center CLI. 

> [!TIP]
> Most App Center CLI commands can be shortened by using `appcenter apps set-current <ownerName>/<appName>`. By setting an app as the current app you no longer have to use the -a flag to specify the app you're trying to perform the command on.

**Creating an App in the App Center CLI:**

```shell
appcenter apps create -d MyApp -o iOS -p React-Native
```

**Releasing an Update App Center CLI:**

```shell
appcenter codepush release-react MyApp 
```

**List App Deployments App Center CLI:**

```shell
appcenter codepush deployment list MyApp
```

## FAQ
#### Will the move impact my customers?
No.

#### What changes for CodePush?
For now, the only significant change is the use of the App Center CLI and the structure of the commands. No changes in your code will be necessary until the release of the new SDK, which currently has no ETA. The CodePush team is greatful for your help in making CodePush successful. It wouldn't be possible without such an amazing community.

#### Is using CodePush functionality still free?
Yes.

#### Why the move?
Moving to App Center means more support, more resources, and a home among Microsoft's first class services for mobile development.

#### Can I still log on?
Yes.

#### Can I continue to use the CLI?
Yes, we're committed to maintain the CLI through September 2018. You're free to continue using the CLI, but all features besides release and viewing metrics will be disabled in Late March 2018. Finally, the CodePush CLI will be retired in Mid-October 2018.

#### Will I need to create a new account for App Center if I already have one?
If you used the same email for both accounts, you can log into App Center using your original account. If not, one will be created for your CodePush app. To manage your apps from the same account, create an organization in App Center, add your new account to it, and transfer your app to the organization.
