# Migrating Existing Services

[!INCLUDE [Retirement announcement for App Center](../includes/retirement.md)]

App Center is the future of HockeyApp and CodePush.

It provides a unified suite of services for the continuous integration of building, testing, distributing to testers, monitoring for crashes, and tracking user analytics. Some of these capabilities are built from ground-up while the rest us existing services like HockeyApp (Distribute & Crashes services) and Xamarin Test Cloud (Test service) under the hood.

## [HockeyApp](~/transition/index.md)
HockeyApp has been retired and all apps have been migrated to App Center.
